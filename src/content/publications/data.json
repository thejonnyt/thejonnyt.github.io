The diagnostic process is particularly complex given symptom overlap with other mental disorders and high rates of co-occurring physical and mental health concerns. The aim of this study was to conduct a data-driven selection of the most relevant diagnostic information collected from a behavior observation and an anamnestic interview in two clinical samples of children/younger adolescents and adolescents/adults with suspected ASD. Via random forests, the present study discovered patterns of symptoms in the diagnostic data of 2310 participants (46% ASD, 54% non-ASD, age range 4–72 years) using data from the combined Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview—Revised (ADI-R) and ADOS data alone.",

The present work systematically examines the importance of items from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) in discerning children with and without ASD. Knowledge of the most discriminative features and their underlying concepts may prove valuable for the future training tools that assist clinicians to substantiate or extenuate a suspicion of ASD in nonverbal and minimally verbal children.",
