    "Hi! My name is Johannes. I'm a technical generalist who's into optimizing systems and workflows — whether that's architecting {{microservices}} and their {{devops}}, fine-tuning {{ml}} pipelines, or finding the optimal badminton strategy or biking setup.",
    "One of my many interests is the AI revolution: {{llm}}s, its software and infrastructure which makes intelligence scale. To not only witness but help shape these developments drives me every day!",
    "Knowledge for me is one of the most exciting and important things out there. AI democratizing knowledge and lowering access barriers for everyone sounds great to me.",
    "I balance screen time with hands-on work (e.g., catering gigs), teach myself piano and Japanese for fun, and give pro bono stats tutoring because knowledge should be shared.",
    "Currently, I'm looking for new challenges. If you think I'd be a good fit for your company and team, feel free to reach out!"
