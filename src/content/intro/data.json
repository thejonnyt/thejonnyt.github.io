    "Hi! My name is Johannes. I'm a technical generalist who's into optimizing systems and workflows — whether that's architecting {{microservices}}, fine-tuning {{ml}} pipelines, finding the optimal badminton strategy or biking setup.",
    "My current obsession is the AI revolution: {{llm}}s, the software and infrastructure that makes intelligence scale. I believe in enabling potential through data and objective reasoning, in questioning society's 'best practices' against first principles, and in building technology that augments not only human but also machines' capability. To me, Knowledge is the most fun and the ongoing trends could result in sharing that fun with everyone, and I think thats awesome.",
    "I balance screen time with hands-on work (e.g., catering gigs keep me grounded), teach myself piano and Japanese for fun, and give pro bono stats tutoring because knowledge should be shared. Also, I generally don't take the privilege of loving to live in these exciting times or any other of my privileges for granted - yet I am very aware of them."
